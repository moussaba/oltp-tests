Anonymous Usage Reporting / Statistics: If enabling the anonymous usage reporting / statistics feature, some information about the Phoronix Test Suite runs will be submitted to OpenBenchmarking.org. This information is used for analytical purposes, including but not limited to, determining the most popular tests / suites and calculating average run-times for different test profiles. The test results are not reported in this process nor the installed software / hardware information, but ambient information about the testing process. This information is stored anonymously. More information on this feature is available with the included documentation.

Anonymous Software / Hardware Reporting: If enabling the anonymous hardware / software reporting, general information on your installed hardware / software components will be reported to OpenBenchmarking.org. Hardware information is general details such as, but not limited to, the installed CPU, motherboard, and other general components. Software information is general and contains details such as your operating system, graphics processor driver, kernel, and software architecture. No personal information is collected. This information is pooled along with the submissions from all other users to show general trends and other details on OpenBenchmarking.org.
