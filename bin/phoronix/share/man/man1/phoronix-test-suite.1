.SH NAME
phoronix-test-suite \- The Phoronix Test Suite is an extensible open-source platform for performing testing and performance evaluation.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B phoronix-test-suite [options]
.br
.B phoronix-test-suite benchmark [test | suite]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Phoronix Test Suite is the most comprehensive testing and benchmarking platform available for Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and BSD operating systems. The Phoronix Test Suite allows for carrying out tests in a fully automated manner from test installation to execution and reporting. All tests are meant to be easily reproducible, easy-to-use, and support fully automated execution. The Phoronix Test Suite is open-source under the GNU GPLv3 license and is developed by Phoronix Media in cooperation with partners.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.SH TEST INSTALLATION
.B install [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...
This option will install the selected test(s) inside the testing environment directory). The install process from downloading of the test files to the installation is fully automated. The install option needs to be supplied with the test name or suite as an argument. Optionally, a OpenBenchmarking.org ID or the name of a saved results file can be supplied as well and the test(s) to install will automatically be extracted from that information. If the test is already installed and was run by the latest version of the installation process, no action will be taken. Multiple arguments can be supplied to install additional tests at the same time.
.TP
.B install-dependencies [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...
This option will install the external dependencies needed by the selected test(s) using the distribution's package management system. For example, some tests depend upon GCC for compiling code. If GCC is not detected on the system, the Phoronix Test Suite will attempt to install GCC using the distribution's package management system. If you are running this command as a local user, you may be prompted for the root password while the process is running. For unsupported distributions, the dependency names will be displayed along with common names for the package. The install-dependencies option needs to be supplied with the test name or suite as an argument. When using the install option, the external dependencies are automatically checked.
.TP
.B make-download-cache
This option will create a download cache for use by the Phoronix Test Suite.
.TP
.B remove-installed-test [Test]
This option will permanently remove a installed test by the Phoronix Test Suite.
.TP
.SH TESTING
.B benchmark [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...
This option will install the selected test(s) (if needed) and will proceed to run the test(s). This option is equivalent to running phoronix-test-suite with the install option followed by the run option. Multiple arguments can be supplied to run additional tests at the same time and save the results into one file.
.TP
.B finish-run [Test Result]
This option can be used if a test run had not properly finished running all tests within a saved results file. Using this option when specifying a saved results file where all tests had not completed will attempt to finish testing on the remaining tests where there are missing results.
.TP
.B run [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...
This option will run the selected test(s).
.TP
.B run-tests-in-suite
This option can be used if you wish to run all of the tests found in a supplied suite, but you wish to re-configure each of the test options rather than using the defaults supplied by the suite.
.TP
.SH BATCH TESTING
.B batch-benchmark [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...
This option and its arguments are equivalent to the benchmark option, but the process will be run in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode.
.TP
.B batch-install [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...
If you wish to run the install process in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode but do not wish to run any tests at this time. Running the install process in the batch mode will use the default values and not prompt the user of any possible options, to ensure the process is fully automated.
.TP
.B batch-run [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...
This option and its arguments are equivalent to the run option, but the process will be run in the Phoronix Test Suite batch mode.
.TP
.B batch-setup
This option is used to configure the batch mode options for the Phoronix Test Suite, which is subsequently written to the user configuration file. Among the options are whether to automatically upload the test results to OpenBenchmarking.org and prompting for the saved file name.
.TP
.B default-benchmark [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...
This option will install the selected test(s) (if needed) and will proceed to run the test(s) in the defaults mode. This option is equivalent to running phoronix-test-suite with the install option followed by the default-run option.
.TP
.B default-run [Test | Suite | OpenBenchmarking.org ID | Test Result]  ...
This option will run the selected test(s). The name of the test or suite must be supplied or the OpenBenchmarking.org ID or saved local file name. Multiple arguments can be supplied to run additional tests at the same time and save the results in a suite-like fashion. Unlike the normal run option, the default-run will not prompt the user to select from the available test options but will instead use the default options as automatically set by pts-core or the test profile. Use batch-run to automatically test all of the available options.
.TP
.SH OPENBENCHMARKING.ORG
.B clone-result [OpenBenchmarking ID]  ...
This option will download a local copy of a file that was saved to OpenBenchmarking.org, as long as a valid public ID is supplied. More than one ID can be specified and the results will then be merged.
.TP
.B openbenchmarking-changes
This option will list recent changes to test profiles of enabled OpenBenchmarking.org repositories.

This option is used for controlling your Phoronix Test Suite client options for OpenBechmarking.org and syncing the client to your account.
.TP
.B openbenchmarking-refresh
This option is used for refreshing the stored OpenBenchmarking.org repostory information and other data. The Phoronix Test Suite will automatically refresh this data every three days or when other thresholds are exceeded, but this command can be used to manually refresh/updates the data.

.TP
.B upload-test-suite
This option can be used for uploading a test suite to your account on OpenBenchmarking.org. By uploading your test suite to OpenBenchmarking.org, others are then able to browse and access this test suite for easy distribution.

This option will generate a candlestick graph showing the distribution of results from all trial runs. The candlestick graph is similar to the Japanese candlestick charts used by the financial industry, except instead of representing stock data it is numerical result data from all trial runs.\n\nThe tip of the upper-wick represents the highest value of the test runs with the tip of the lower-wick representing the lowest value of all test runs. The upper-edge of the candle body represents the first or last run value and the lower-edge represents the first or last run value. Lastly, if the last run value is less than the first run value, the candle body is the same color as the graph background, otherwise the last run value is greater.
